        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
            I am a recent graduate of BS Computer Science from De La Salle Dasmari√±as. I have worked at Trend Micro as a Cyber Threat Defense Engineer where I gained hands-on experience in Malware Analysis, Threat Detection, Reverse Engineering, Script Deobfuscation and Analysis, and Web and Email Threats Analysis. I also have an experience in Python/Web Development when I worked as a Junior Developer at Doodlepress Media Consulting where using Python Django framework, we developed an Electronic Vehicle Management System that lets the users see all the available charging stations on the map, as well as the charger type and specifications on every charging station.
